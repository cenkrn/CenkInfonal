Cenk Oran Özdemir / n11.com Project

   Firstly, i want to thank to Infonal company because they provide me to new challange that was unknown area 
for me so i had a new capability about automation tools this way. Only writings, prototypes and 
videos made me to took a level to wrote complex automated test cases.

The project includes two test cases ;

   1.Facebook class : 
     REQUIREMENTS : 1-2.

   - User enter with his/her facebook account. If they are not logged in facebook, username and password screen 
should be displayed.
   - n11.com main page should be displayed after login and it shoud be accepted.

RESULT : There is no error. 

   2.Writers class : 
     REQUIREMENTS : 3-4-6.

   - This tests provide pagination control. It controls that last name of page lists top of second page of 
   writers again?
   - Testing of Book/Writers page.
   - Already Logged Facebook users should enter automatically. 
    
PRECONDITIONS: The user can be logged in Facebook.
     
   - I,Ç,İ,J,O,Ö,Q,V,W,X,Y and Z letters have one page.

- RESULT: There is no defect. 
   - NOTE : Nihat Genç listed two times in both pages ;
            He has two different entry in database with different links. 
            It is a database defect not a pagination.
